Please can somebody help me I'm begging

I'm trying to use the authenticator and I get my Google account 
on an iPhone with Microsoft account 
and everything else is just messed 
up and I can't figure it out and I'm very angry

It keeps asking me to change the same Google account 
and I keep changing it over and over I don't know 
what I'm doing wrong It's really getting frustrated it's 
been for five years this has been going on And then when 
I go ahead and I try to use the apps on my computer it doesn't
 work I don't know i've been here almost 20 years and I get 
nothing out of it but a big heart headache $600 on my bill 
that investing I never hear from anybody I get hub Google 
or read it and now I can't even get into my regular Reddit account

Please if anybody can help I really really need it
